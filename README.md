# Rare Diseases Clustering Analysis

This project presents an exploratory clustering analysis using KMeans on a dataset related to rare diseases. The main goal was to identify potential patient subgroups based on continuous variables, which could help generate hypotheses for further clinical research.

## Contents

- Data exploration and normalization
- Silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Final clustering and interpretation
- Visualizations of identified groups

## How to run

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repository>.git
````

2️⃣ Open the notebook (`Jan_kmeans.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

3️⃣ Run all cells and adjust the dataset path if needed.

## Results

* Automatic estimation of the best number of clusters using silhouette score.
* Visual representation of identified groups.
* Basic summary of cluster characteristics, which can be refined for clinical interpretation.

## Required libraries

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

Install them with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Context

This analysis is part of my final project for a Data Science postgraduate course. It demonstrates my ability to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to biomedical data and to present findings clearly.
